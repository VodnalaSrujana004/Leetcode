You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aababbab"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can either:
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 2 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aaabbb"), or
Delete the characters at 0-indexed positions 3 and 6 ("aababbab" -> "aabbbb").
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbaaaaabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: The only solution is to delete the first two characters.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is 'a' or 'b'​​.

        int c=0;
//building suffix array
        for(int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            if(s.charAt(i) == 'a') c++;
            suf[i] = c;
        }
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if(ch == 'a') continue;
           // take b
            a1 = Math.min(a1, cur+suf[i]);
            // remove b , op++
            cur++;
        }

        int ans = Math.min(cur, a1);
        return ans;
    }
