Given an m x n integer matrix heightMap representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return the volume of water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:


Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.
The total volume of water trapped is 4.
Example 2:


Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
Output: 10
 

Constraints:

m == heightMap.length
n == heightMap[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 104


------------------------------------------

Intuition
The problem can be visualized as filling water in a 3D elevation map. Imagine the boundaries as walls that hold water, and the height of the walls determines how much water can be trapped. By using a priority queue (min-heap), we simulate this process, starting from the lowest boundary and working inward, while marking cells as visited to avoid reprocessing.

🛠️🚀 Approach
🏗️ Boundary Initialization:

Add all boundary cells into a min-heap with their heights. These boundaries define the limits of water trapping.
Mark boundary cells as visited using a 2D array to prevent redundant processing.
📉 Process Cells from the Min-Heap:

Extract the cell with the smallest height from the heap.
For each of its 4️⃣ neighboring cells:
Calculate the trapped water:
waterTrapped += max(0, currentHeight - neighborHeight).
Update the neighbor's height to the larger of its own height or the current height, simulating water filling.
Push the updated neighbor into the heap and mark it as visited.
🔁 Repeat Until the Heap is Empty:

Continue the process for all cells in the heap until no more cells are left.
✅ Return the Result:

The accumulated water is returned as the result.
⏱️📊 Complexity
⏳ Time Complexity:

Each cell is processed once, and heap operations take (O(\log(m \times n))).
Overall complexity: O(m×nlog(m×n)).
💾 Space Complexity:

Space is used for the visited array and the min-heap.
Overall complexity: O(m×n).
