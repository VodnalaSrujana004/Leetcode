You have a grid of size n x 3 and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

Given n the number of rows of the grid, return the number of ways you can paint this grid. As the answer may grow large, the answer must be computed modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 1
Output: 12
Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5000
Output: 30228214
 

Constraints:

n == grid.length
1 <= n <= 5000

class Solution {
    private static final long MOD = (long)1e9 + 7L;

    public int numOfWays(int n) {
        return (int)(numOfWays(6L, 6L, n - 1) % MOD);
    }

    private long numOfWays(long threes, long twos, int n) {  // threes refer to 012 pattern, twos refer to 010 pattern 
        if (n <= 0)
            return threes + twos;
        return numOfWays((2L * threes + 2L * twos) % MOD, (2L * threes + 3L * twos) % MOD, n - 1) % MOD;
    }
}
