On a social network consisting of m users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer n, an array languages, and an array friendships where:

There are n languages numbered 1 through n,
languages[i] is the set of languages the i​​​​​​th​​​​ user knows, and
friendships[i] = [u​​​​​​i​​​, v​​​​​​i] denotes a friendship between the users u​​​​​​​​​​​i​​​​​ and vi.
You can choose one language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return the minimum number of users you need to teach.

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if x is a friend of y and y is a friend of z, this doesn't guarantee that x is a friend of z.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]], friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.
 

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 500
languages.length == m
1 <= m <= 500
1 <= languages[i].length <= n
1 <= languages[i][j] <= n
1 <= u​​​​​​i < v​​​​​​i <= languages.length
1 <= friendships.length <= 500
All tuples (u​​​​​i, v​​​​​​i) are unique
languages[i] contains only unique values

Intuition
The problem is about ensuring that all friendships can communicate in at least one common language. If two friends cannot communicate, at least one of them must learn a new language. We need to find the minimum number of users that must be taught to achieve this.

Approach
Iterate through all friendships.

For each friendship, check if the two users already share a language.

If not, mark both users as candidates for learning.

For each possible language:

Count how many of the candidate users don’t already know it.
This gives the number of users we’d need to teach if we chose that language.
Return the minimum count across all languages.

Complexity
Time Complexity:
For each friendship, we compare languages → worst case O(F × L²) where F = number of friendships, L = average number of languages per user.
Checking each language across all users → O(U × L × T) where U = number of users, T = totalLanguages.
Overall, it stays efficient for typical constraints.

Space Complexity:
We mainly use a set of candidate users → O(U).


class Solution:
    def minimumTeachings(
        self, n: int, languages: List[List[int]], friendships: List[List[int]]
    ) -> int:
        cncon = set()
        for friendship in friendships:
            mp = {}
            conm = False
            for lan in languages[friendship[0] - 1]:
                mp[lan] = 1
            for lan in languages[friendship[1] - 1]:
                if lan in mp:
                    conm = True
                    break
            if not conm:
                cncon.add(friendship[0] - 1)
                cncon.add(friendship[1] - 1)

        max_cnt = 0
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for friendship in cncon:
            for lan in languages[friendship]:
                cnt[lan] += 1
                max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt[lan])

        return len(cncon) - max_cnt
