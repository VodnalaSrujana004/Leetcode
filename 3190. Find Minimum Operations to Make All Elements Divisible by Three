You are given an integer array nums. In one operation, you can add or subtract 1 from any element of nums.

Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums divisible by 3.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 3

Explanation:

All array elements can be made divisible by 3 using 3 operations:

Subtract 1 from 1.
Add 1 to 2.
Subtract 1 from 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,6,9]

Output: 0

 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 50

------------------------------------------------

class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        for ( int x : nums){
            int rem = x % 3;
            sum += Math.min(rem, 3 - rem);

        }
        return sum;
    }
}

Approach: Traversal
Intuition
For any integer x, there are two possible ways to make it divisible by 3:

The number of operations required to increase x to the next multiple of 3 is 3−(xmod3).
The number of operations required to decrease x to the nearest multiple of 3 is xmod3.
Choose the option that requires fewer operations.

For each number in nums, calculate the minimum number of operations and sum them up to obtain the result.
